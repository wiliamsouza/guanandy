Guanandy
========

A class control written in Qt using python and pyside.

It is more a proof of concept that it's possible to use zeromq with
openpgm for multicast network comunication using a wireless network.

And that sometime is more easy rewrite a software using new tecnologies
than lose time with poor code. 

At this early stage  guanandy is only suitable for developers who want 
to contribute.
